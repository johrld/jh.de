After 30+ years in the digital business, I'm starting my personal blog. A place for thoughts, experiences and lessons from the world of tech, AI and entrepreneurship.

## Why now?

The pace at which AI and technology are evolving is unprecedented. At the same time, there's so much knowledge from decades of building companies that's worth sharing.

## What to expect?

- **Tech & AI** — Insights into new technologies, tools and how AI is changing the way we work
- **Entrepreneurship** — Lessons learned from building multiple companies
- **Personal** — Thoughts on productivity, mindset and life as a founder

Looking forward to the exchange.
